#### Quick installation instructions

**I. If you are an Arch Linux user, or if you are using one of the Arch Linux derivatives,** you may want to use pre-compiled packages from the `[infinality-bundle]` repository I maintain. This is a recommended approach in a majority of cases as it gives access to the entire functionality offered by Infinality patches and the ultimate configuration without a typical post installation routine.


> **NOTE**
> Make sure your distribution has been fully updated and is using the most recent libraries
> as present in the official Arch Linux repositories. Using outdated system components with
> the bundle is not recommended as it may severely break your system.


For more information, see:

* [Infinality-bundle+fonts](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality-bundle+fonts) (install notes, troubleshooting)
* [infinality-bundle: good looking fonts made (even) easier](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=162098) (official infinality-bundle support thread for Arch Linux users)
* [infinality-bundle-fonts: a free multilingual font collection for Arch](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=170976) (official infinality-bundle-fonts support thread)

**II. If you still prefer or have to go the generic way,** i.e. install `freetype2-infinality` from the AUR, you can use [fontconfig-infinality-ultimate-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate-git/) and build it on your own. The git version may be less stable than the one available in my repository since it is a testing ground for future `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` official releases. When you are done with installation, you will have to copy custom `infinality-settings.sh` from `/usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate-git/freetype` to `/etc/profile.d` and replace the one that came with the non-bundle `freetype2-infinality`.

**III. If you are using any Linux distribution but Arch Linux or its derivative,** you can use all available resources here to rebuild `fontconfig` package available in your distribution. (For pre-2.10.93 versions of stock `fontconfig`--especially version 2.10.92--check the `infinality-bundle` branch of this repo for compatible patches.) Building a patched version of `fontconfig` should be relatively easy: all you will need is appropriate `src` and `devel` packages and libraries and your favourite text editor to modify the build script. You can always use Arch's PKGBUILD as a model to follow. If you have questions, please consult your distro's documentation and community.


> **NOTE**
> Before installing any patched version `fontconfig`, backup the whole `/etc/fonts` directory
> in case something goes wrong and you are sure it has nothing to do with your local ``fontconfig``
> configuration, usually available in `$HOME/.config/fontconfig`. This way you can simply revert
>  your setup to its previous state.


> **NOTE**
> Start troubleshooting by temporarily disabling your local `fontconfig` configuration. It may be
> possible that your personal configuration overrides and interferes with global `fontconfig` settings.


Last but not least, don't forget to copy custom `infinality-settings.sh` from `/usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate-git/freetype` to `/etc/profile.d` and replace the one that came with the non-bundle `freetype2-infinality`.


#### Further customization and misc options

* Many changes to the global `fontconfig-ultimate` settings can be introduced on a per-user ground in a local `$HOME/.config/fontconfig` directory. Please, consult `/usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate{-git}/ fontconfig` for examples and templates you will need to start tweaking.

* At the moment, there are two font collections supported by `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` out of the box: a free one (activated by default), available for Arch Linux users as easy to install packages, and a proprietary one (Microsoft's fonts supplied with MS Windows and MS Office). If you want to switch between them, use `fc-presets` script. There is also a `custom` preset available for highly customized font collections. Configuration files for all the presets are located in `/etc/fonts/conf.avail.infinality/`.

* If you are using a desktop environment (KDE, Gnome) that lets you adjust font settings on its own, you can duplicate the base values as found in `/etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh`.

* All the necessary build scripts can be found in `infinality-bundle` branch. It should not be a very demanding task to 'translate' them for use in your own Linux distribution.
