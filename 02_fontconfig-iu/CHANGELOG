=======================

CHANGELOG
---------

2014-07-20
~~~~~~~~~~

### infinality-bundle-fonts

Noto family packages were upgraded to the most recent upstream release, bringing extensive support for many additional non-Latin languages. Consequently, the following font families were moved to the `extra` collection and removed from the `ibfonts-meta-extended` meta package:

* `otf-melthofonts-ibx`
* `ttf-ipafont-ibx`
* `ttf-lklug-ibx`
* `ttf-nanum-fonts-ibx`
* `ttf-mph-2b-damase-ibx`
* `ttf-tharlon-ibx`
* `ttf-wqy-microhei-ibx`

Unless needed, they can be safely uninstalled from the system.

Non-Latin font families were split from `ttf-droid-ib` in order to eliminate potential interference with higher quality Noto fonts. The extra Droid typefaces are available as `ttf-droid-nonlatin-ib` and can still be installed if necessary.

A new dependency, Faruma (`ttf-faruma-ib`) was added to `ibfonts-meta-extended` for proper Thaana script support.

Besides, the following fonts were added to the repository:

* `otf-source-han-sans-cn-ibx`
* `otf-source-han-sans-jp-ibx`
* `otf-source-han-sans-kr-ibx`
* `otf-source-han-sans-twhk-ibx`

The packages can be installed either individually, or all in one shot using `source-han-sans-cjk` group name.

### fontconfig-infinality-ultimate, rev. 2.11.1-17

* The library was updated in accordance with the changes to the `infinality-bundle-fonts` repository.
* Additional templates, which can be used to customize default aliases globally, were added to `35-repl-custom.conf`. GNU Emacs users may want to uncomment the sans-serif entry to set Liberation Sans as a safe alias for their editor.

2014-07-16
~~~~~~~~~~

### infinality-bundle-fonts

* Oxygen family (`ttf-oxygen-ibx`) was added to the repository.
* Source Sans Pro (`otf-source-sans-pro-ibx`, `ttf-source-sans-pro-ibx`) was upgraded to version 2.0.10 (roman variants).

2014-07-09
~~~~~~~~~~

### infinality-bundle-fonts

* Cooper Hewitt family (`otf-cooper-hewitt-ibx`) was added to the repository.
* Roboto family (`ttf-roboto-ibx`) was upgraded to version 2.0 (a.k.a 2014).

Both font sets come with fixed weight metrics.

2014-07-08
~~~~~~~~~~

### freetype2-infinality-ultimate, rev. 2.5.3-8 (incl. multilib)

* Merging with most recent upstream commits.
* Updating Infinality patchset accordingly.

2014-07-01
~~~~~~~~~~

### infinality-bundle-fonts

* Permian family (`otf-permian-family-ibx`), including sans, serif and slab variants, was added to the repository.

### fontconfig-infinality-ultimate, rev. 2.11.1-16

* New aliases were added to the `free` preset (enhancement #27).
* Changes to the `combi` preset:
    * Basic aliases (sans-serif, serif, monospace, fantasy & cursive) are based on default `free` seetings.
    * No major font family, free or proprietary, is replaced by alternative typefaces and is identified by its generic name.

2014-06-18
~~~~~~~~~~

### infinality-bundle-fonts

* Roboto family (`ttf-roboto-ibx`) including Condensed and Slab variants, was added to the repository.
* Vollkorn (`ttf-vollkorn-ibx`) was added to the repository.
* Minor change to Droid Mono family was introduced, fixing the inconsistency between the regular weight and synthetic emboldening.
* Font names in `ttf-himalaya-fonts-ibx` were corrected.
* Minor tweaks to `ttf-khmer-os-ibx` config files were introduced.

2014-06-12
~~~~~~~~~~

### infinality-bundle-fonts

About 150 font packages were updated. Rendering settings were revised, simplified where possible and standardized. Redundant and duplicated settings were removed on a per-family basis.

The following packages were added to the repository:

* Heuristica (`ttf-heuristica-ibx`)
* Paratype (`ttf-paratype-ibx`)
* Raleway (`otf-raleway-ibx`)
* Signika & Signika Negative (`ttf-signika-ibx`)
* Source Code Pro (`otf-source-code-pro-ibx`)
* Source Sans Pro (`otf-source-sans-pro-ibx`)
* Source Serif Pro (`otf-source-serif-pro-ibx`)
* Luxi family (`ttf-bh-ib`)

The following packages were upgraded:

* `otf-heuristica-ib`, v.1.0.2
* `ttf-liberastika-ib`, v1.1.4
* `otf-vollkorn-ibx`, v3.005

The following packages were removed:

* `t1-adobe-utopia-ib` (replaced by `otf-heuristica-ib`)
* `t1-ibm-courier-ibx` (replaced by `ttf-courier-prime-ib`)

**Updates requiring user intervention:**

* The Chinese branch of DejaVu family, DejaVu Sans YuanTi, needs to be downgraded due to the change in version numbering. The following packages are affected:

    * `ttf-dejavusans-yuanti-basic`
    * `ttf-dejavusans-yuanti-condensed`
    * `ttf-dejavusans-yuanti-mono`

* `ttf-pfeffer-mediaeval-ibx` was correctly renamed to `otf-pfeffer-mediaeval-ibx`. In order to upgrade, remove the `ttf` package and install the new one then.

### fontconfig-infinality-ultimate, rev. 2.11.1-15

Rendering instructions for all packaged font families were split to individual packages. The benefits of such a solution are the following:

* Simpler maintenance: leaving only global settings to `fontconfig-iu` and most per-family instructions to individual font packages allows for easier debugging and code updates to both.
* Reduced size and easier accessibility of generic `fontconfig-iu` config files.
* Greater font configuration flexibility and lesser probability of interference between settings crafted for `infinality-bundle-fonts` families and fonts installed from third-party sources, i.e. relevant rendering instructions are added when a font package is installed and removed when the font is no longer present in the system.

Users who do not use `infinality-bundle-fonts` and install fonts either from official Arch Linux repositories, the AUR or random sources can still take advantage of per-family rendering instructions included in the packages. In order to add support to preconfigured fonts, they will need to create symbolic links to fontconfig settings provided in `/usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate/font-settings/`, e.g.

    # cd /usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate/font-settings
    # ls *amble*
    45-amble.conf  90-tt-amble.conf
    # ln -sr *amble.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/

In case of multiple configuration files (e.g. `90-non-tt-signika.conf` and `90-tt-signika.conf`) it is necessary to choose the correct one depending on the format to be used, i.e. `90-tt-foo.conf` for TrueType fonts and `90-non-tt-foo.conf` for OpenType/Type 1.

For unsupported fonts new settings should be created, otherwise they will be rendered using the default auto-hinter. If this is the case, a user can either file a bug report on GitHub or open a pull request and submit her/his custom configuration files.

* Fixing [bug 7752](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77252).


2014-04-09
~~~~~~~~~~

### infinality-bundle-fonts

The following packages have been added to the collection:

* `ttf-ipafont-ib` (new default for Japanese script)
* `ttf-nanum-fonts-ib` (new default for Korean script)
* `ttf-nanumgothic-coding-ibx`
* `ttf-pfeffer-mediaeval-ibx` (for mediaevalists)
* `ttf-tharlon-ib` (new default for Buginese / Myanmar scripts)
* `ttf-triod-postnaja-ibx` (for Old Church Slavonic language)
* `ttf-wqy-microhei-ib` (new default for Chinese script)
* `ttf-lohit-fonts-ib` (the entire family for all Indic scripts, incl. early releases)

The following packages have been moved to the `extra` group (they can be installed on demand):

* `otf-libre-baskerville-ib`
* `t1-cantarell-ib`
* `t1-paratype-ib`
* `ttf-himalaya-fonts-ib`
* `ttf-myanmar3-ib`
* `ttf-sawarabi-ib`
* `ttf-unfonts-core-ib`
* `ttf-vlgothic-ib`

Unless needed, they can be safely removed from the system.

The following packages have been merged:

* `ttf-droid-ib` and `ttf-droid-monovar-ib`
* `otf-alegreya-ibx` and `otf-alegreya-sans-ht-ibx`

* An additional meta package -- `ibfonts-meta-extended-lt` -- was added for users who want to install extended collection of fonts without support for non-Latin language scripts.


### fontconfig-infinality-ultimate, rev. 2.11.1-3

* `93-final-lang-spec-foo.conf` config files have been deprecated.
* `65-non-latin-foo.conf` files have been revised and updated to reflect changes to the `infinality-bundle-fonts` and provide more reliable selection of pre-assigned fonts.
* A new globally enabled `67-override-aliases.conf` config file was added.
  If a font is distributed in multiple variants and under different names, documents pointing to its most common global alias may not recognize it and not use it even if one of the versions is locally present (e.g. Inconsolatazi4 vs Inconsolata). Additional configuration file listing acceptable and preferable local names fixes the problem.
* `fc-presets` has been updated to reflect changes to preset files.

### Appendix

~~~~~~~~~~

* The entire fontconfig-infinality-ultimate structure was reworked
  to better fit within fontconfig configuration principles. The 'nesting'
  style configuration model known from generic fontconfig-infinality
  has been entirely abandoned marking mutual independence of both
  packages.

* Default Serif, Sans-Serif and Monospace faces are now set hierarchically in
  `/etc/fonts/conf.d/60-latin.conf`. In order to override these settings, the
  user is supposed to create a custom file in the local, XDG compliant
  fontconfig directory (a relevant example has been provided). Once
  custom settings have been created, they will be honored by applications.

* Consequently, any further user customizations should be introduced in
  the local fontconfig files as far as possible.

* Templates for user customizations have been updated.

* A couple of default font substitutions (this should solve recurring
  problems with Helveticas):
  - Helvetica => TeX Gyre Heros || Arial || Liberation Sans || Arimo
  - Helvetica Neue => Open Sans

* Rendering parameters for numerous fonts have been tweaked / fixed /
  modified.
