conf.d/README

Each file in this directory is a fontconfig configuration file.  Fontconfig
scans this directory, loading all files of the form [0-9][0-9]*.conf.
These files are normally installed in ../conf.avail and then symlinked here,
allowing them to be easily installed and then enabled/disabled by adjusting
the symlinks.

The files are loaded in numeric order, the structure of the configuration
has led to the following conventions in usage:

 Files begining with:	Contain:

 00 through 09		Font directories
 10 through 19		system rendering defaults (AA, etc)
 20 through 29		font rendering options
 30 through 39		family substitution
 40 through 49		generic identification, map family->generic
 50 through 59		alternate config file loading
 60 through 69		generic aliases, map generic->family
 70 through 79		select font (adjust which fonts are available)
 80 through 89		match target="scan" (modify scanned patterns)
 90 through 99		font synthesis

If you are using fontconfig-infinality-ultimate from the infinality-bundle
collection, configuration files are located in ../conf.avail.infinality and
they are symlinked here instead. Besides, there are four more subdirectories
located in the main template direcotory: three of them provide necessary
configuration files (depending on which font collection you are using)

 ../conf.avail.infinality/combi - for a custom, user-compiled collection
 ../conf.avail.infinality/free  - for the free font collection, available in the
                                  infinality-bundle-fonts repository (default in
                                  Arch Linux)
 ../conf.avail.infinality/ms    - for the proprietary font collection available
                                  with Microsoft Windows and Office software
                                  (not freely available)

The fourth one, ../conf.avail.infinality/ftypes, provides optional base
rendering instructions for fonts that are not installed by default and are
available in multiple formats (TrueType, OpenType and Type 1). See
../conf.avail.infinality/README for instruction on how to use them.

The stock fontconfig template directory and configuration files are still
available for compatibility reasons and should not be removed.
