conf.d/README

Each file in this directory is a fontconfig configuration file.  Fontconfig
scans this directory, loading all files of the form [0-9][0-9]*.conf.
These files are normally installed in @TEMPLATEDIR@
and then symlinked here, allowing them to be easily installed and then
enabled/disabled by adjusting the symlinks.

The files are loaded in numeric order, the structure of the configuration
has led to the following conventions in usage:

 Files begining with:	Contain:

 00 through 09		Font directories
 10 through 19		system rendering defaults (AA, etc)
 20 through 29		font rendering options
 30 through 39		family substitution
 40 through 49		generic identification, map family->generic
 50 through 59		alternate config file loading
 60 through 69		generic aliases, map generic->family
 70 through 79		select font (adjust which fonts are available)
 80 through 89		match target="scan" (modify scanned patterns)
 90 through 99		font synthesis

If you are using fontconfig-infinality-ultimate from the infinality-bundle
collection, templates are located in @TEMPLATEINFDIR@ and they
are symlinked here instead. Besides, there are three more subdirectories
located in the main template directory, each containing collection-specific
fontconfig configuration files:

 @TEMPLATEINFDIR@/combi - for a custom, user-compiled collection
 @TEMPLATEINFDIR@/free  - for the free font collection, available in the
                                  infinality-bundle-fonts repository (default in
                                  Arch Linux)
 @TEMPLATEINFDIR@/ms    - for the proprietary font collection available
                                  with Microsoft Windows and Office software
                                  (not freely available)

Symbolic links in conf.d to all five *.conf files from one of either combi,
free or ms need to be created in order for default aliases and font
substitution rules to work properly.

The stock fontconfig template directory and configuration files are still
available for compatibility reasons and should not be removed.
